                <br>

                <p class="content-body">Welcome to the galaxy far, far away! In a time of unrest and conflict, the
                    forces of the light and dark side are locked in a fierce battle for supremacy. Amidst this chaos, a
                    crucial mission has emerged that will shape the course of the war.
                </p>
                <p class="content-body">As the game begins, you find yourself in the middle of a desperate struggle
                    between the BB8 and BB9E droids, two of the most advanced hacking units in the galaxy. Their task is
                    to break into a heavily fortified enemy ship and steal vital information that could turn the tide of
                    the war in favor of their respective sides.
                </p>
                <p class="content-body">As you take control of one of these droids, you will need to use your wit,
                    skill, and cunning to outsmart your opponent and gain access to the ship's defenses. With time
                    running out and the fate of the galaxy at stake, every move counts in this epic showdown between two
                    of the most iconic characters in the Star Wars universe.
                </p>
                <p class="content-body">This is a 2 player hot seat game where each player will have a limited amount of
                    time to make their moves before the turn shifts to the other side. You will need to act quickly and
                    decisively if you want to succeed in this mission. With so much at stake, there is no time for
                    hesitation or second-guessing.
                </p>
                <p class="content-body">Get ready to immerse yourself in an unforgettable adventure that will test your
                    strategic prowess, reflexes, and problem-solving skills. Whether you're a die-hard Star Wars fan or
                    a newcomer to the franchise, this game promises to be an exciting and engaging experience that will
                    leave you on the edge of your seat. May the Force be with you!
